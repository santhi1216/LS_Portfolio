# ðŸ§  Data Analysis Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains a collection of real-world projects where I explore data, uncover insights, and present findings using Python and data visualization techniques.

Each project is self-contained with its own code, data (or data source), and documentation.
